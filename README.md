# multi_Weather_IoT
The project aims to study, design and implement an IoT system that will monitor the environment at specific points.
Temperature, Humidity, Luminosity, Î‘ir quality(CO2, Toluene, NH4) will be collected so the system will allow the visualization of the state of the environment at the points of interest. We can compare in real and past time the different environments.
